When pulling the data it becomes clear what areas have a higher population and more activities for them to go out and do. When you look at the Urban enviournemnt we see 1,625 or 68.5% of the total people utilizing ride share are living in urban areas, 625 or 26% live within the Suburban areas and 125 or 6% are out in the Rural areas. You’ll also notice that there’s a 1.5 driver to rider ratio in Urban areas, 0.78 driver to rider ratio in Suburban areas and 0.62 driver to rider ratio our in Rural areas. This could also mean your wait time and cost to utilize the ride share service will be higher in Rural areas, second longest wait and cost in the Suburban areas while it’ll be faster and cheaper within the Urban areas. This is a good example of supply and demand.
